Feature Section:

Wall Collision Feature 

Description: This feature ensures that players cannot pass through walls while moving within the maze. In this way, the feature improves gameplay by creating a more realistic and challenging atmosphere for the players, thus adding an essential layer of functionality into the 3D environment.

Project Inspiration:

Growing up, I always enjoyed playing games that were very much immersive and realistic. Ironically, I never thought I'd see myself on the creation side of such games. When the opportunity to build a 3D game came through the ALX School Portfolio Project, I knew how interesting it would be to understand the inner mechanics of designing games. Over a span of 3 weeks, I dove headfirst into this project, determined to explore the fundamentals of game development and test my coding skills.
